                <p>Where did time go? Was <em>Astro Bot</em> a temporal vortex in disguise? Is this how playing in those McDonald's ball pits from the 90s used to feel? And where did the weekend go?</p>

                <p>There is so much <em>joy</em> in this game. Among what felt like a thousand unexpected highlights, rapidly happening one after the other... maybe my strongest dork reaction came from the sudden appearance of the McDohl bot—totally out of the blue, as in a first playthrough of <em>Suikoden II</em>. It felt like Christmas, a birthday present, and some sort of climax to many years of playing.</p>

                <p>Recruiting the 108 Stars of Destiny is—to this day—still on my bucket list, but with <em>Astro</em> I just couldn’t stop and ended up collecting everything. I left my memory card with aching hands after a final challenge that kicked my ass... but also with a rekindled desire to finish my abandoned run through the <em>Uncharted</em> series. The <em>astro-remix</em> of <em>Nate's Theme</em> actually made me emotional.</p>

                <p>This was also the end of an improvised trilogy of 3D platformers. And I guess I can see myself going after the few Figments I missed in <em>Psychonauts 2</em>... but... <em>Mario Odyssey's</em> 999 Power Moons?</p>

                <p>I would need another time vortex. Or retirement.</p>

                <p>I went back to the great <em>Astro's Playroom</em>—first act of the PS5's arrival in 2020. I still had a bunch of artefacts and puzzle pieces left to find, multiple speedrun levels to love, and some cameos I can now recognize. The PSP was the last thing I found, which felt right.</p>

                <p>In 2023, playing the new <em>The Last of Us Part I</em> with <a href="https://valstuff.com/">Val</a> became one of the highlights of our gaming life together; powerful from start to finish, and just listening to <em>The Path</em> right now makes me want to go back and play it once again. Then, early this year, we just had to follow it up with the remaster of <em>Part II</em>... which inevitably was a harder pill to swallow; just as brutal as it was at launch... and let's not ever mention Ellie's fingers to Val...</p>

                <p>(&gt;_&lt;) (&gt;_&lt;)</p>

                <p>For some reason, we went back to it this weekend—finally checked out the <em>Lost Levels</em>, and played a few runs of <em>No Return</em>. I think we're both now wishing for some kind of <em>Part III</em> taking shape somewhere... if only for more Gustavo tracks in the repertoire.</p>

                <p>Marketing for <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> seems to be ramping up online, and the little I've seen of it has made me realize that the <em>BioWare</em> logo still holds some power over me; <em>Knights of the Old Republic</em>, <em>Jade Empire</em>, <em>Mass Effect</em> and <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>... that's a big chunk of my formative experiences with games.</p>

                <p>After <strong>long</strong> playthroughs of the original <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, and both <em>Remake</em> and <em>Rebirth</em> back to back, I'm ready for something different—and if I want deep dialogue options and tons of in-game books and codex entries to read in my RPG now, I guess I can't go wrong with a return to the first <em>Dragon Age</em>, fourteen years since my awkward high-school-dropout self played it first.</p>

Who knows, maybe I'll find my way into <em>The Veilguard</em> eventually.</p>

                <p>The grasslands in <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> weirdly remind me of <em>Forza Horizon 4's</em> <em style="font-size: 16px;">soon-to-be-sadly-delisted</em> countryside; the environments in <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, on the other hand, seem to exist somewhere between a painting and a poem.</p>

                <p>Even though the opening hours of <em>Rebirth</em> already feel <strong><em>very</em></strong> different from <em>Remake</em>, my brain is still being wowed by the reimagining work. As for <em>Elden Ring</em>, I've decided to take everything <strong><em>very</em></strong> slowly, focusing mostly on exploring the map and picking up stuff—occasionally facing a new type monstrosity.</p>

                <p>These are the days of fantasy.</p>

Especially now that I've returned to what little I remember from my youthful "<em>GraphicsGale</em> days" and started learning about spriting and pixel art once again. I'm not great at it, but hopefully, one day it'll turn into something I can be proud of</p>

                <p>Avoiding Mohg <em style="font-size: 16px;">(and Malenia)</em> like the plague back then has now resulted in a sort of test to see if I should get <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, or not.

                <p>Having played all the <a href="#sigmund-sunday">"Sigmund Corp."</a> games back-to-back (and... also... <em>The Mirror Lied?</em>), I found myself digging through the Internet Archive to find a download for <em>Quintessence: The Blighted Venom</em>.

                <p>I'm too curious now.</p>

                <p>The first chapter was very charming, and funny; and even though the music is, without a doubt, the biggest star of the game so far, there’s something <strong>really</strong> powerful in seeing XP’s graphics for me.</p>

                <p>Oddly, these five games have been in my head for the past few <s>YEARS</s> days, as I think over the idea of a game I would like to make. I've been thinking of maybe replaying them all for a third time, not only because time with Rosa and Joey is always an awesome idea, but because this time I’ll be particularly interested in all the developer commentaries stuff.</p>

                <p>Dave Gilbert is an inspiration.</p>

                <p>Just as much as Ron Gilbert.</p>

                <p>So much to play, and so much to do... but... I could start with a visit to <em>The Blackwell Legacy</em>. To keep the ghosts of the series at bay.</p>

                <p>In reality we were without power for only an hour or so, but it was more than enough for me to randomly pick up the Switch and play through a game that Val had bought yesterday on an indie sale. The game is called <em>Florence</em>, and it turned out to be a great reminder of <a href="#vivi-and-edith">my wish</a> for smaller experiences; for games that feel like reading a short story, or watching a short film... mostly in between all of the gigantic RPGs that I so naturally favor.</p>

                <p>Almost without text, and with gameplay mechanics that were both clever and beautiful, the story in <em>Florence</em> made time fly by.</p>

                <p>160 stamps later... I’ve put <em>Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising</em> down.</p>

                <p>There was a moment, halfway through a fetch quest, when something in those balloon reactions popping above the characters’ heads unlocked <strong>many</strong> fond memories for me. They reminded me of being fourteen years old, tinkering with <em>RPG Maker 2000</em> and <em>2003</em>; of being wide-eyed and dreaming big with the release of <em>RPG Maker XP</em>. I remembered making ugly sprites in a program called <em>GraphicsGale</em>, and falling in love with <em>Suikoden II’s</em> sprite sheets way before playing the game itself.</p>

                <p>I think I’ll give <em>RPG Maker MZ</em> a closer look.</p>

                <p>Writing “substories” for <em>Yakuza</em> games <em>has</em> to be a super fun job. So far the ones in <em> 0</em> are like a batshit crazy anthology of weirdness that I'm loving just as much as I love stamps. Haven’t laughed this much with a video game in a long, long time.</p>

                <p>I’m surprisingly hooked on the whole <em>Real Estate Royale</em> thing and the idea of becoming <strong>The Ultimate Monopoly King of Kamurocho</strong>, but also craving for more of Majima's storyline and Sotenbori's nightlife aesthetics. Is the <em>Cabaret Club Czar</em> minigame going to be as addicting? Will it lead to more substories?</p>

                <p>We handed over the keys to our old apartment today, and it instantly felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. Now there’s even a humongous long weekend incoming, almost a big quest reward for our troubles. Six free days for us to be still, and relax. For coffee, and video games.</p>

                <p>As <a href="https://valstuff.com" target="_blank">Val</a> made her way back to <em>Disco Elysium's</em> embrace, I took a look at the calendar and realized that it's high time for me to start preparing for April’s biggest event: <s>My birthday!</s> The release of <em>Eiyuden Chronicles: Hundred Heroes</em>! Yoshitaka Murayama final game; a dream of hundreds coming true.</p>

                <p>I saved <em>Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising</em> for precisely this moment, and it turned out to be the perfect companion game for <em>anxiety-packed</em> days: It's repetitive, simple, and whatever the opposite of “a slog” is. I’m enjoying its humor a lot, as well. I might even be as addicted to stamps as CJ herself at this point.</p>

                <p>New Nevaeh is right. The world needs more stamp systems.</p>

                <p>Finished <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> today... and I already miss it.</p>

                <p>It took me a ridiculous amount of hours to reach the end of the game, but this story is one of those that will stay in my mind for a long while. Loved the use of so many Greek myth elements, and I found the whole journey inspiring. I look forward to whatever <em>The Answer</em> will add in September... and watching the movies!</p>

                <p>The party is looking sharp, now that Amada, Aragaki and scene-stealer Koromaru have joined. In terms of character design and personalities, this might well be my favorite main cast from the <em>Persona</em> games I’ve played. Maybe the fact that they all live together in the same dorm also gives them more of a found family feel. But same as with 4 and 5 before, surely I’m going to be all emotional once the end credits roll and it's time to say goodbye.</p>

                <p>First, I confirmed how much I like Mohammad Fahmi's characters and dialogue; then... well, guess I had no clue of how freaking incredible <em>Edith Finch</em> was going to be. No clue at all.</p>

                <p>I’ll never know someone who loves coffee shops more than <a href="https://valstuff.com" target="_blank">Val</a>. Discovering new ones in our city and making travel plans around them has basically become one of our main life missions. Even in games: just yesterday we spent a good amount of time walking around <em>The Last of Us Part II’s</em> Seattle, often doing virtual photography in the post-outbreak ruins of multiple coffee places.</p>

                <p>So... it should not be surprising that <em>Coffee Talk</em> ended up being her first video game purchase ever.</p>

                <p>Nor that its soundtrack is now on loop all day.</p>

                alt="A pixelated poster that says Drown your troubles in coffee">

                <p>The game is wonderful, and for us one of its most special elements (aside from the constant rain) were the short stories that one of the characters writes and gets published in-game. We really loved those... so it was super heartbreaking to learn later that Mohammad Fahmi, the real writer of those stories and designer of the game itself, passed away in 2022. There was even a beautiful tribute for him in <em>A Space for the Unbound</em> that I’m just realizing...</p>

                <p>I definitely want to play <em>What Comes After</em> soon. And as of today, <em>After Love EP</em> is one of my most anticipated games of the year.</p>

                <p><em>Papers, Please</em> reappeared in my mind, so suddenly.</p>

                <p>Maybe because we watched the <em>Tetris</em> movie, full of spies and soviet bureaucracy stuff; maybe it was all the paperwork that me and <a href="https://valstuff.com" target="_blank">Val</a> were busy gathering for the past few days, looking to rent our first place together. Whatever the reason, I remembered <em>Papers, Please</em>, and got stuck with the fact that I never got to finish it when I tried it in 2016, just a few months before immigrating myself out of my own ruinous government, and the multiple-year quest for residency that followed.</p>

                <p>It's been almost 8 years since I packed and moved to Argentina. Feels strange to look back at my silly 26-year-old self, so far from the pandemic, totally ignorant of how to live in a country that has winters. I would have been so freaking lost without <a href="https://vicfernandez.com/" target="_blank">Vic</a>.</p>

                <p>I was also far from being able to afford a game console. Back then, things like <em>Gone Home</em>, <em>Papers, Please</em> and <em>The Blackwell Legacy</em> were making me realize that indie games for my PC existed.</p>

                <p>We finished watching <em>Bakuman</em> last week. I had devoured the manga many years ago, and I wanted to share with Val some of that dreams-fueled determination I felt from its very first chapter.</p>

                <p>Now she’s Nizuma Eiji’s number 1 fan.</p>

                <p>Later I found that there’s a <em>Bakuman</em> video game for the DS; but… the cruel reality is that it’s only in japanese, with no translation in sight. Regardless, I had to try it on the 3DS, and Google Translate’s camera made the visual novel segments shockingly readable. Then I got to the actual manga-making mechanics of the game and all went to hell. Inking lines as Mashiro was super fun, but the plot creation minigame with Takagi was hard to understand. There's even a moment, on this gamified creative process, when you get to go around the city looking for inspiration and stuff to use on the storyline you're writing. At that moment I was 100% sure that I would love this game, if only I could understand it.</p>

                <p>I managed to play all the way up to the first meeting with Hattori.</p>

                <p>He gave my manuscript a 0 in story, and a 0 in art.</p>

                <p>Guess this one will have to remain forever a dream.</p>

                <p>The first <em>Max Payne</em> feels very nostalgic, very 2001, and is still surprisingly fun to play. Noir New York City atmosphere... Max’s heavy-on-the-metaphor monologues... The animation for reloading the dual berettas... There's a lot to love here. It's also cool to see Remedy already playing with storytelling and meta stuff, almost foreshadowing <em>Alan Wake 2</em>.</p>

                <p>The graphic novel panels were a brilliant idea.</p>

                <p>I have a <em>“space-scoundrel”</em> character in <em>Starfield</em> that's taking things very, very slowly. Every now and then I start the game and continue my walk up and down New Atlantis for a few minutes, mostly talking to a few NPCS before I sign off.</p>

                <p>But then, yesterday... the <em>Adoring Fan</em> made its entrance.</p>

                <p>I haven't connected with a Bethesda RPG in a <strong>long</strong> time, but the importance of <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> in my gaming life can't be overstated. I need to give <em>Starfield</em> more time.</p>

                <p>So, even though <em>SMRPG</em> got way better now,  I’ve been also trying to play some indies that have been on my list long enough for them to have already become classics. I went with <em>Oxenfree</em> and <em>Her Story</em>; I think this can illustrate my experience with both:</p>

                <p>Año nuevo! A new chance to not succumb into the fear of missing out! Games-wise, life-wise and otherwise-wise.</p>

                <img src="images/blog/dordogne-poem-1.png" 
                alt="Momentary joy; Touched by an unexpected silence; I am Ok... I think..."
                class="blog-entry-scrap"
                style="max-width: 330px;">

                <p>The first couple of days were a bit bumpy at home, with an internet outage that <strong>hopefully</strong> got resolved today. But... in the meantime, I got to carry on with something that is slowly becoming a personal tradition: starting the year with a slice-of-aesthetically-wholesome-life game, abstaining from the stresses of combat and heavy puzzles. It started in 2022, blissfully delivering mail in <em>Lake</em>; then in 2023 the turn was for <em>Shin chan: Me and the Professor on Summer Vacation. The Endless Seven-Day Journey</em>. Now, for 2024, the chosen one was... <em>Dordogne</em>. A game that made me feel like I was living inside a French comic book.</p>

                <img src="images/blog/dordogne-poem-2.png" 
                alt="Absorbed by the shiny water; Peaceful view on my heart; We are the Queens of Dordogne"
                class="blog-entry-scrap"
                style="max-width: 330px;">

                <p>Same as the other two games mentioned, <em>Dordogne</em> captures the feeling of long summer days away from the city, having few responsibilities and anxieties. We’re at the beginning of summer here in Argentina, but in regards to experiencing the outdoors... <em>Dordogne</em> definitely has the best version of it: idealized and in beautiful watercolor art. I loved the game, and in this entry I’ve left a couple of the poems you get to write for one of its most important activities: filling up a scrapbook with memories of the days passed. Kind of reminded me of this blog.</p>

                <p>Here’s an outdoorsy Polaroid that <a href="https://valstuff.com/" target="_blank">Val</a> took:</p>

                <p>This blog did not exist in May. Because of that, it has zero ramblings about Link humming Saria’s Song while cooking, or just how awesome Penn looks. However, I just couldn't let 2023 end without mentioning <strong><em>The Legend</em></strong>. At least once.</p>

                <p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom </em> already feels very nostalgic to me. Thinking about all the fun things I did inside of Hyrule, sort of time-travels me back to the places me, <a href="https://valstuff.com/" target="_blank">Val</a> and the Switch were outside of the game, in the coldest days of this last winter. The beauty of life and portable consoles, I guess.</p>

                <p>How long will it be until another year with a new Zelda?</p>

                <p>I did not expect to be back in the chains, just one year after Ragnarök. And I definitely did not expect to feel moved by a free roguelike DLC, of all things..</p>

                <p>Last year, and in preparation for Ragnarök, I resurrected my PS3 and spent the entirety of July feverishly comboing through <em>God of War</em>, <em>God of War II</em>, <em>God of War: Chains of Olympus</em>, <em> God of War III</em>, <em>God of War: Ghost of Sparta</em>, <em>God of War: Ascension</em> and, to wrap things up <em>norsely</em>, a re-play of <em>God of War (2018)</em>.</p>

                <p>Except for some confusing puzzles here and there, and the <strong>accursed</strong> Trials of Archimedes, I enjoyed them all a lot.</p>

                <p>Today, completing “The Work” questline in <em>God of War: Valhalla</em> has brought me an entirely different kind of satisfaction. A feeling that is, nevertheless, deeply connected to that brutal wrecking of the Greek world from the old games.</p>

                <p>It was beautiful, enlightening... and super fun.</p>

                <p>How is this free?</p>

                <p>. . .</p>

                <p>P.S. Thinking of old gods and free stuff has reminded me of two things: First, <em>Hades II</em> is in development; second, I should take a look at those Greek myth books that Wally lent me...</p>

                <p>Completing what <em>Disco Elysium’s</em> many dice rolls started last year, <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> has finally opened a door to a type of video game that I've been trying to get into, ever since I heard of <em>Icewind Dale</em> as a teenager. For some reason I can’t count <em>Knights of the Old Republic</em> in this opening-of-the-door thing.</p>

                <p><em>I just couldn't see the dice rolls.</em></p>

                <p>But I’m hooked now, and <a href="https://valstuff.com" target="_blank">Val's</a> christmas gift is the perfect totem for this brand new obsession. The field of RPGs I can pick to play now is definitely not a lake, but an ocean.</p>

                <p>Quite the change of scenery for the mind, to go from Bright Falls, Washington, to Providence Oaks, Oregon. One created in Finland  and the other in the Netherlands, funnily enough.</p>

                <p>Though <em>Alan Wake’s</em> ending still haunts me, I’m sort of resisting the urge to go back and start <em>The Final Draft</em> just now. I think I’ll save that replay for a rainy day. Instead, I’ve decided to fully embrace the red-and-green spirit and played <em>Lake’s: Season’s Greetings</em>—a Christmas special for one of my favorites “slice-of-life” games of recent years. At the same time, Val got to <strong>marathon</strong> her first winter in <em>Stardew Valley</em>, so the red-and-green spirit at home was definitely at its strongest.</p>

                <p>At least gaming-wise. It's getting warmer here, in the southern hemisphere. So far from Twin Peaks and <em>"America's Little Finland."</em></p>

                <p>Finishing chapters in <em>Alan Wake</em> leaves me not only with awesome songs to put on repeat and sing with my girlfriend, but also with a sense of tension in the body that reminds me a bit of when I marathoned <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> over a weekend.</p>

                <p><em>Bellinghamania</em> is fully underway, and not since <em>Zizou</em> was appointed Madrid's manager in 2016 have I been this excited about the future of the club. I needed <em>something</em> from video games to carry me on this wave, but I was soon confronted with a landscape that couldn't be more horrifying:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><em>PES</em> is dead, and Master League is still missing in action.</li>
                    <li>eFootball plays well, but the online mode it promotes is awful and boring.</li>
                    <li>Football Manager is too dangerous of a drug. I should stay away.</li>
                    <li><em><s>FIFA</s> EA Sports FC</em> is... uh... well... the only choice, I guess.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The only <strong>current</strong> choice to have some sort of old-school career mode. Sadly, it also feels terrible to play, with players flying and skating across the pitch—weird physics, perfect first touches, and insanely precise shot accuracy.</p>

                <p>Unless... <a href="https://forums.operationsports.com/forums/ea-sports-fifa-sliders/1014656-ea-sports-fc-24-os-community-sliders.html" target="_blank">a small Christmas miracle</a>.</p>

                <p>A few days ago, <a href="https://valstuff.com/" target="_blank">Val</a> got some time off from work, and I watched her play through the final stages of <em>Unpacking</em>. I loved how moving the ending was for us, and how beautifully it captured the idea of moving to a new place together. It also made me wish I had kept at least a couple of my gaming relics, and how wild it would be to see my old bootleg NES console again, paired with a <em>Flintstones</em> game that I rented so much my dad ended up buying it.</p>

                <p>Nostalgia-wise, I have to be content with the ROM of <em>76-in-1</em> I found online, played with an Xbox controller. I had totally forgotten about <em>Battle City</em>, <em>Urban Champion</em>, <em>Tennis</em>... <em>Mabby</em>!</p>
                
                <p>They were <strong>hard</strong>.</p>

                <p><em>Super Mario Bros.</em> being the first thing I ever played is probably a good guess, but it is definitely hard to know for sure. In my 90s-kid memories of games, there's a lot of jumping and falling to my death in those first two stages of the original World 1, but also some fragments of <em>Pac-Man</em>, <em>Circus Charlie</em>, <em>Excitebike</em>, <em>Battle City</em>, <em>Ice Climber</em>... an Atari game titled <em>Keystone Kapers</em>?</p>

                <p>It's impossible to know for sure, really, but in my heart, I believe Mario was the first one. Probably.</p>

                <p>But! The year is 2023—I'm super old now and <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> and its wonderful Wonder Seeds are working on me as the best remedy for a heart that misses his comrades and adventures in <em>Baldur's Gate</em>, still. The game feels fantastic, and surely will become the very first Mario I play to the end.</p>

                <p>In a way, Wonder <em><strong>is</strong></em> my first Super Mario game.</p>

                <p>Games spent enough time in my head for the creation of this site to feel almost inevitable. Or maybe it has to do with the year ending?</p>

                <p>In any case, <strong>here it is!</strong> I'm not entirely sure of what the goal for this rambling is, but for now I hope that someday it could be fun to look back at these thoughts and remember the good, the bad... and how breathtaking my first playthrough of <em>Baldur's Gates 3</em> was.</p>
